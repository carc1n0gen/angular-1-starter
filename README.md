# Angular 1 Starter
=================

This is my boilerplate starting point for developing angular 1 applications. It uses webpack to compile and bundle es2015+ javascript and sass.

# Developing

For developing apps on top of this repo there are a few useful commands:

`npm run dev`: Build the bundles

`npm run watch`: Watch for changes and rebuild bundles

`npm run prod`: Build minified bundles for production use

`npm run hot`: Start the webpack dev server with hot reloader

`npm run clean`: Clear the generated bundles from the dist directory

# But the year is 2099 - Why Angular 1?

Angular 2+, React, Vue, Riot, etc. are cool but sometimes I want good old angular 1.  I've gotten very confortable with it having used it for so long.
