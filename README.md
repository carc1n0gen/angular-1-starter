Angular 1 Starter
=================

This is my boilerplate starting point for developing angular 1 applications. It uses webpack to bundle javascript and sass.

Developing
----------

For developing apps on top of this repo there are a few useful commands:

`npm run dev`: Build the bundles

`npm run watch`: Watch for changes and rebuild bundles

`npm run prod`: Build minified bundles for production use

`npm run hot`: Start the webpack dev server with hot reloader

But it's 2017 - Why Angular 1?
------------------------------

Angular 2+, React, Vue, Riot, etc... are cool but sometimes I want good old angular 1.  I use it everyday at work so it's what I am most confortable with.
