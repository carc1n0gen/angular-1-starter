Angular 1 Starter
=================

This is my boilerplate starting point for developing angular 1 applications. 
It uses webpack to bundle javascript and sass.

Developing
----------

For developing apps on top of this repo there are a few useful commands:

`npm run dev`: Build the bundles

`npm run watch`: Watch for changes and rebuild bundles

`npm run prod`: Build minified bundles for production use

`npm run hot`: Start the webpack dev server with hot reloader
